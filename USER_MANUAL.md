The app tracks when you first encounter each word and schedules reviews at scientifically-proven intervals:

1. **First Review**: ~7 days after first seeing a word
2. **Second Review**: ~14 days after first encounter
3. **Third Review**: ~28 days after first encounter
4. **Ongoing**: Words continue to appear for review to maintain long-term retention

Words appear in the "Due Today" counter and are prioritized in quizzes and spaced recall sessions.
